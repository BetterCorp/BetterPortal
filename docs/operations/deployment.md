# Deployment

BetterPortal deploys as multiple independently running services.

At minimum, a deployment needs a theme service and at least one business service. Admin and auth services can be added as needed.

## Deployment units

| Unit | Example |
|---|---|
| Theme | `@betterportal/theme-bootstrap1` |
| Admin service | `@betterportal/config-manager` |
| Docs service | `@betterportal/docs-site` |
| Business service | `@betterportal/hello-view` |
| Auth service | `@betterportal/auth` |

## Hostnames

The app hostnames in `bp-config.yaml` must match the public hostnames users visit.

Service hostnames must be reachable by the browser, because the theme does not proxy page content.

## Build

Build the workspace before deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

For services with route changes, make sure codegen has run:

```bash
npm run bp-codegen
```

## Operational checks

Every service should expose:

```text
/.well-known/bp/health
/.well-known/bp/manifest
/.well-known/bp/schema.json
```

Use these endpoints for health checks and manifest validation.
